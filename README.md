# Operationalize Generative AI applications on AWS

With the rising popularity of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), organizations are experimenting with Large Language Models (LLMs) and observe the immediate benefit they provide to their business. Thus, LLMs become a part of an organization technology stack. The need to integrate these models' lifecycle into the software development lifecycle (SDLC), establishing best practices to optimize speed, cost, and quality, becomes a priority. 

This workshop will give you hands-on experience operationalizing Generative AI applications on AWS.

# Agenda

This workshop can be completed in 6-8 hours, either self-paced or instructor-led, depending on the participant's familiarity with AWS, DevOps and Generative AI concepts. It is divided into two parts:
- Part 1: Deploy Generative AI applications to AWS
    - Writing infrastructure as code (IaC) with AWS CDK
    - Deploying the demo application to AWS
    - Building a CI/CD pipeline with AWS CodePipeline

- Part 2: Evolving Generative AI applications
    - Introduction to Amazon Bedrock
    - Implementing continuous fine-tuning
    - Implementing retrieval augmented generation (RAG)

# Pre-requisites

- Basic understanding of AWS, DevOps and Generative AI concepts.
- Basic understanding of the Python programming language.
- An AWS account with administrative privileges.
- A computer with an internet connection.
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- A GitHub account with access to [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).

If you do not have access to GitHub Codespaces:
- Visual Studio Code installed on your local machine.
- Docker installed on your local machine.

> It's recommended that you attempt this workshop in a [development container](https://containers.dev/), or [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), using the provided configuration. By doing so, you avoid the hassle of setting up your local development environment and ensure that all the necessary tools and dependencies are readily available.
