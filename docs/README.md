# Operationalize Generative AI applications on AWS

With the rising popularity of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), organizations are experimenting with Large Language Models (LLMs) and observe the immediate benefit they provide to their business. Thus LLMs become a part of an organization technology stack. The need to integrate these models lifecycle into the software development lifecycle (SDLC), establishing best practices to optimize speed, cost, and quality, becomes a priority. 

This workshop will give you hands-on experience operationalizing Generative AI applications on AWS.

# Agenda

This workshop can be completed in 6-8 hours, either self-paced or instructor-led, depending on the participant's familiarity with AWS, DevOps and Generative AI concepts. It is divided into two parts:
- [Part 1: Deploy Generative AI applications to AWS](/part-01/)
    - Introduction to the demo application
    - Writing infrastructure as code (IaC) with AWS CDK
    - Deploying demo application to AWS
    - Building a CICD pipeline with AWS CodePipeline

- [Part 2: Evolving Generative AI applications](/part-02/)
    - Introduction to Amazon Bedrock
